# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43

# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/loading/
    - assets/images/onboarding/
    - assets/images/recipes/
    - assets/images/icon/
    - assets/images/icons/
    - assets/images/calories/breakfast/
    - assets/images/calories/dinner/
    - assets/images/calories/snacks/
    - assets/images/calories/lunch/
    - assets/images/network/
    - assets/images/profile/
    - assets/images/difficulty/
    - assets/translations/
    - assets/model/



  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: BalooBhaina
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/BalooBhaina2-Regular.ttf
    - family: Kine
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/kinetika-black.ttf
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
